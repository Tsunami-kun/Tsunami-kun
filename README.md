- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tsunami.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m enthusiastic in robotics and EAI, especially the field of robotic manipulation.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently focusing on visuo-tactile-motor learning for humanoid robots and dexterous hands, especially on exploring novel real2sim2real methods.
- ðŸ˜„ I believe solid real-world demonstrations are the central criterion of robotic science, which require the advancements of both robotic "brains" and robotic mechatronical systems.
