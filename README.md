- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tsunami.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m enthusiastic in robotics and EAI, especially robotic manipuations with dual dexterous hands. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently focusing on robot learning for human-like upper body skills, using technologies like video prediction, causal reasoning, and affordance learning.
- ðŸ˜„ I believe solid real-world demonstrations are the central criterion of robotic science and systems, which require both advanced robotic "brains", humanoid limbs, and dexterous manipulators.
