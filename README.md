- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tsunami-kun
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m enthuastic in robotics and EAI, especially robotic manipuations with dual dexterous hands. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently focusing on technologies such as video prediction, causal reasoning, and affordance learning to enable robots to develop human-like upper body skills.
- ðŸ˜„ I believe solid real-world demonstrations are the central criterion of robotic science and systems, which requires both advanced robotic "brains", humanoid limbs, and dexterous manipulators.
